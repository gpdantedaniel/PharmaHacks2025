# The Chicken Dinner Dilemma: Sequence Alignment for AMR
From Undercooked Chicken for Dinner to Unstoppable Superbugsâ€” Can AI Modeling Stop the Next AMR Outbreak?
## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using Supervised Learning. The model is trained to learn from human-aligned sequences and predict optimal gap insertions to improve sequence alignment. The goal is to enhance alignment quality while minimizing unnecessary gaps, ensuring better performance in downstream biological analysis.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is loaded from a pickle file named `data_hackaton_train.data` provided to us. It underwent an 80/20 test-split to test our model before receiving the testing data.

## Usage
To use the model with a new dataset, run the `for_judges.py` Jupyter Notebook and link your desired dataset or simply use the Google Collab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NZp7MRYnbJf7i8haVR4bXVkjgbQrufJj.
